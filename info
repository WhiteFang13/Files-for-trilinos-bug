The matrix A is sparse. The file A.txt contains the matrix A, where every first number is the element index, and the second nuber is its vslue, in the current row.
Other elements are equal zero. For example, the first row is
0 -0.0078125 8 -0.00260417 9 -0.00260417 17 -0.00260417 33 -0.00130208 46 -0.00390625 52 -0.0416667
In this row the element #0 = -0.0078125, #8 = -0.00260417, #9 = -0.00260417, #17 = -0.00260417, #33 = ..., and #46 = ..., #52 = ...;
other elements in this row are zero.
